# Spooky season awaits!
While the community awaits KoTH v3, the rest of the staff team will be closer then ever to the community by hosting various events throughout the next months, giving away in-game items and discounts in our store. Those who are active in the community might've seen moderators, seniors and admins carrying out small events in-game.

As you asked, we are bringing in events for our community over discord and game server(s). The funniest clip event is brewing where players compete to prove the superiority of their sense of humor when it comes to their clips. In the upcoming weeks, we have more events planned to give back to the community that has been supportive of our server since day 1.

Got your own ideas for events you think we should run? [Let us know in our discord community thread!](https://discord.com/channels/793176002850193419/1021784071531135016) Keep a keen eye out on our discord and social communications throughout October as you never know what kind of spooky surprises are in the works (there will be lots of events, exclusive perks, rewards and some hefty store discounts)! ðŸŽƒ

  

## Framework v3 Progress?

This month we have had a lot of focus on our new shop interface and putting some thought into how we can rework our attachments (and by extension), prestige systems.
We know you are all interested in seeing some of the new features so you can see a screenshot below of how the new "attachment bench" may end up looking like!

That's all you're seeing this month, we have to keep some things a secret!

## Staging access applications are open!
Are you interested in helping us develop the new KoTH framework (v3), this includes all the latest spoilers and access to help us test new features before the go live? This is your chance to get in.

Staging access will be a separate server that will run in parallel to our main server, the database will be separate and things like levels and money will be arbitrarily given and change depending on what we want to test with the group at that time.
We ask anyone on the staging team to keep progress, screenshots and chat about any new features private - leaking or sharing them with the general community will just result in you being removed from the staging team.

**Prior to v3 release:** Staging will be application only. See the bottom of the post for the link you will need to apply. The questions are fairly simple and mostly include general community knowledge. For our first round we will be taking between 50-100 applications forward to join the team.

**Post v3 release:** Staging will still be around after the release of v3. One of our main goals of v3 is to improve stability and testing in our deployments. Once v3 is launched to the public we will be automatically inviting all active MVP subscriptions to the staging access along side our monthly application reviews.

So you're interested? [Good! Check out the application link here: https://forms.gle/Zaehjh4du8uhV24o9](https://forms.gle/Zaehjh4du8uhV24o9)

We anticipate a large volume of applications, we will be unable to provide you with individual feedback/notice on your application. If you do not receive a notification of you're acceptance by the last day of each month then feel free to apply again on the 1st (as applications will reset monthly, 1st being the first day you can apply for that period).
